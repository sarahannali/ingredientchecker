In China, the extract is known as Huang-Qin or golden herb, because the root is a golden yellow color. It\u2019s primarily used in cosmetics for its promising ability to interrupt the creation and transfer of excess pigment; however, these scientific studies were done in vitro on skin cells, not intact skin on people struggling with dark spots, so what seems exciting in a lab setting may not hold as much promise for topical use. The other issue is the current lack of agreement on how much of this root extract is needed to visibly fade skin discolorations; some say 0.1% is enough, others recommend at least a 1% concentration is necessary, and some blends with this ingredient encourage amounts of 3-10% if the goal is visible improvement of skin color. The root is more exciting because it contains baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, wogonin, and oroxylin A, all of which are flavones, a type of antioxidant that lend color to various plants and are known to be soothing. Scutellaria baicalensis root can help skin better withstand environmental aggressors that can worsen the look of many common skin concerns, so it certainly has value. Testing on mouse, rabbit, and guinea pig skin revealed that a standardized extract of this ingredient is not irritating or sensitizing, even when the skin was compromised. The conclusion was that Scutellaria baicalensis is a viable option for sensitive skin struggling with signs of uneven skin tone or just in need of soothing.

The unique fluid properties of silicone give it a great deal of slip, and in its various forms it can feel like silk on skin, impart emollience, and be a water-binding agent that holds up well, even when skin becomes wet. The research about silicones have proven them to be superior scar-healing ingredients, soothing agents, non-irritating, and uniquely effective delivery and suspending agents for a wide range of cosmetic ingredients. There are numerous forms of silicones used in cosmetic products, particularly leave-on skincare products and all manner of hair-care products. Common forms of silicone are cyclopentasiloxane and cyclohexasiloxane; other forms include various types of dimethicone and phenyl trimethicone.Claims that silicones in any form cause or  worsen skin concerns have not been substantiated in any published research, nor have reports that silicones are sensitizing to or somehow \u201csuffocate\u201d skin. In fact, just the opposite is true which makes the misinformation difficult to understand. Almost all of the claims about silicones being problematic for skin are apparently myths or based on anecdotal evidence.Because of silicone\u2019s unique molecular properties, they are at the same time porous and resistant though not impermeable to air. Think of silicones in a skincare formula like the covering of a tea bag. When you steep the tea bag in water the tea and all of its antioxidant properties are released into the water. Silicones remain on the surface of your skin and the other ingredients it\u2019s mixed with \u201csteep\u201d through. All ingredients must be suspended in some base formula; some of the ingredients remain on the surface, some are absorbed. The intent is for the \u201cactives\u201d to get through. The special molecular structure of silicones (large molecules with wide spaces between each molecule) allows them to form a permeable barrier and also explains why silicones rarely feel heavy or occlusive, although they still offer protection against moisture loss.Interestingly, silicone has been shown to be helpful for offsetting dryness and flaking from common ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide.Bottom line: The types of silicones used in cosmetic products are supported by scientific research and are considered safe for consumer use. These types of cosmetic silicones are effective, inert, and versatile ingredients that benefit skin and hair in numerous ways.References for this information:International Journal of Pharmaceuticals, March 2017, pages 158-162Molecular Therapy, June 2017, pages 1342-1352 Plastic Reconstructive Surgery Global, December 2016, e1183 Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology, December 2016, pages 13-20 Frontiers in Pharmacology, May 2015, ePublication International Journal of Pharmaceutical Compounding, May-June 2015, pages 223-230 International Journal of Toxicology, May-June 2013, pages 5S-24S Dermatology Research and Practice, October 2010, ePublication Cutis, October 2008, pages 218-284 http://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/formulating/category/antiaging/34408409.html\n"}, {"ingredient": "silk", "rating": "Good", "description": "N/A"}, {"ingredient": "silk powder", "rating": "Good", "description": "\nSynthetically derived powder used as an absorbent and slip agent.\n"}, {"ingredient": "silk protein", "rating": "Good", "description": "\nProtein substance (also called sericin) formed by converting silk, which is the soft, lustrous thread obtained from the cocoon of the silkworm.

Many consumers are concerned of sulfates in their cosmetics products because of widespread misinformation. Sulfates are not a problem, but once organizations and companies build up fears among consumers about certain cosmetics ingredients there\u2019s almost no going back, the damage is done.In reality there\u2019s absolutely no research showing that sulfates are a problem in skincare or hair-care products, other than causing sensitivity, but that is also true for the sulfate-free cleansing agents that some cosmetics companies advertise and sell. And, whether or not a cleansing agent will cause sensitivity depends on the amount of sulfate and on other ingredients present in a specific formula.Following are some of the most typical unsupported comments about sulfates: \u201cSulfate-free shampoos and cleansers are better for hair and skin.\u201d No research has shown that to be even remotely the case. Sulfates are supposed to be terribly drying and damaging to hair, when in fact they function no differently from the cleansing agents in sulfate-free shampoos. Almost every company that touts the fact that they don\u2019t contain sulfates do use detergent cleansing agents such as sodium lauryl sulfoacetate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, cocamidopropylamine oxide, and sodium methyl 2-sulfolaurate.Why those are supposedly any better for skin is never explained, and no research is ever cited\u2014because none exists. Sometimes these companies list those ingredients as being derived from or coming from coconut to make them sound natural and, by association, better for skin\u2014but they all end up being primarily synthetic. That doesn\u2019t make them bad in any way; it\u2019s just that the claims are completely disingenuous. What you need to know is that both the sulfate-free cleansing agents and the sulfate versions can be drying and sensitizing depending on the formulation and/or your skin\u2019s own reaction. All of these cleansing agents remove oil and the gunk from styling products, which is exactly what a shampoo should do.\u201cSulfates in cleansers are cheap.\u201d This one is true, but so what? Lots of ingredients, both natural and synthetic, are cheap, others are expensive, which has absolutely nothing to do with quality or efficacy. The first ingredient in sulfate-free shampoos is water (about 90% water) and no other cosmetic ingredient is cheaper than that!\u201cSulfates are used in floor cleaners and are corrosive.\u201d This can be true, when used in large amounts and when left on surfaces over time, but so what? Salt is used to melt ice on the roadway, but it also rusts cars, which doesn\u2019t make salt bad; it just depends on how much you use and how long you leave it on something. This is also true for the alternative sulfate-free shampoos and cleansers as well; they can also be corrosive over time depending on how much is used and how long it is left on.\u201cSulfates can be sensitizing.\u201d This can absolutely be true, but again, so what? As a general category, sulfates are not sensitizing when used in appropriate amounts in shampoos and cleansers and the same is true for sulfate-free alternative cleansing agents. All of the research about sulfates being sensitizing are from patch tests where a concentration is left on skin under a bandage for 24 hours, which is not how a cleanser or shampoo is used. Sodium lauryl sulfate is considered one of the more sensitizing cleansing agents and we recommend avoiding it when it is high up on the ingredient list, but that\u2019s NOT because it\u2019s a sulfate; rather, it\u2019s because of its interaction with skin.\n"}, {"ingredient": "sulfur", "rating": "Poor", "description": "\nCan be a potent skin sensitizer.

Topically, tranexamic acid works by interrupting at least two pathways in skin that, left unchecked, can lead to discolorations, including larger patches known as melasma. Tranexamic acid also seems to work within skin\u2019s surface layers to make skin color less susceptible to UV light exposure (but of course, you still need sunscreen) and may also reduce redness. Recent, double-blind and comparative research has shown that topical tranexamic acid in amounts between 2-5% rivals results of over-the-counter amounts of hydroquinone, long considered the gold standard for fading skin discolorations. If you\u2019re using a hydroquinone product for lightening, you can add a product with tranexamic acid and potentially see even better results. Comparative studies have shown tranexamic acid has greater tolerability than hydroquinone, although the latter is generally well tolerated when used as directed. Research has shown that tranexamic acid is safe when applied to skin every day for several months. Topical concentrations between 2-5% typically shows results after two to three months of once- or twice-daily usage. Note: Because tranexamic acid is a water soluble ingredient, it needs to be used in skin care products with oil-soluble ingredients designed to improve its penetration into skin. It\u2019s worth mentioning that tranexamic acid is sometimes prescribed for oral use to women experiencing heavy periods or to those with various clotting disorders.

Nonetheless, UVA radiation creates serious cumulative changes in skin that may be far greater than the sunburn caused by UVB radiation. Research has shown that unprotected exposure to UVA rays can, within one week, create distinct injury. Research also indicates UVA exposure is even more damaging than we once knew: it seems that when UVA radiation hits skin, it not only penetrates to skin\u2019s lower layers but the damage \u201cbounces back\u201d like light reflecting from a mirror, giving every layer of your skin a double-whammy of damage.
